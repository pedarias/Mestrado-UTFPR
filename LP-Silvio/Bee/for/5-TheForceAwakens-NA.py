# This Python code reads a matrix of integers and searches for a specific pattern within the matrix.

# Example Input and Output:

# Suppose the input represents a matrix with dimensions 4x5 and contains the following values:

# Input:

# 4 5
# 10 30 20 42 60
# 50 42 80 90 70
# 30 40 42 20 50
# 60 80 70 10 30

# Output:

# 3 4

# Explanation:

#    The input specifies a 4x5 matrix.
#    The code checks each row of the matrix for the presence of the number 42 (the pattern).
#    When it finds the pattern (at coordinates [2, 2] in this example), it calculates the sum of the surrounding numbers. In this case, the sum is 98.
#    Since the sum is 98, the code prints the coordinates [3, 4], which represent the central 42 in the pattern.
