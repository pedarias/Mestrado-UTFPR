    "# 8-Queens Problem with Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Solving the 8-queens puzzle, where the goal is to place eight queens on a chessboard without them attacking each other.\n",
    "- **Method**: Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using the DEAP library in Python.\n",
    "- **Key Concepts**: 8-Queens Problem, Genetic Algorithms, DEAP library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genetic Algorithm Approach\n",
    "- **Population Initialization**: Begins with a randomly generated population of chessboard arrangements.\n",
    "- **Fitness Evaluation**: Each arrangement is evaluated based on how many queens are in non-attacking positions.\n",
    "- **Selection**: Selects the best-performing arrangements for the next generation.\n",
    "- **Genetic Operations**: Applies crossover and mutation to generate new solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DEAP Library Utilization\n",
    "- Used for creating and managing the GA components like individuals, populations, and genetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Implementation\n",
    "- **Code Structure**: Includes Python code for setting up and executing the GA."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This is an evolutionary process over 100 generations. \n",
    "- **Progressive Improvement**:So in generation 0, the average fitness is around 3.94, from generation 0 to 100 there's a decrease in the average fitness (Avg) score. This indicates The genetic algorithm is effectively evolving better solutions over time.\n",
    "- **Optimal Solutions**: The **minimum fitness(Min)** reaching 0 early in the process (by generation 1) and consistently appearing in subsequent generations suggests that the algorithm quickly finds an optimal solution (a configuration with no conflicts) and retains it. This retention is likely due to the selection mechanism favoring individuals with the best fitness scores.\n",
    "- The **maximum fitness(Max)** are relatively high in some generations. This indicates a considerable variation among individuals in the population, with some far from optimal. This diversity is essential as it prevents premature convergence to local solutions.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (Std)**: The standard deviation values, which measure the spread of the fitness values in the population, do not consistently decrease. This non-decreasing, indicates the maintenance of genetic diversity in the population, which is crucial for exploring different parts of the solution space.\n",
    "- **Convergence**: Towards the later generations, the rate of improvement in average fitness decreases, which might suggest the algorithm is converging. This could mean that most individuals in the population are becoming increasingly similar to the best solution found, reducing the effectiveness of genetic diversity."
