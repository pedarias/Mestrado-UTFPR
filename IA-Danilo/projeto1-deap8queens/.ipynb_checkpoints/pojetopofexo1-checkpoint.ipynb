    "## Summary\n",
    "1. DEAP creates an initial population of chessboard arrangements. Each chessboard represents a potential solution to the problem. These initial solutions are generated randomly. (toolbox.population(n=300))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The selection process in a GA prefers solutions (chessboard arrangements, in this case) that have a higher \"fitness\" value. The fitness value represents how good a solution is in terms of solving the problem. Parents are selected from the population based on their fitness values, with a higher likelihood for better solutions to be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now is where the mitosis and meiosis come on. This chessboard arrangements with high fitness values (called parents solutions) are recombined to produce a new solution, which is considered an \"offspring\". This method take parts of both parents' solutions and combining them to create a new solution. Mixing rows and columns from the parent chessboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Mutation: Mutation is a random process that introduces small changes to the offspring's solution. In our case it involves changing the position of a queen on the chessboard. Mutation is used to introduce diversity into the population and could be represented similarly as to avoid getting stuck in a local max/min.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This new offspring forms the next generation of solutions. The old population is typically replaced by this new generation, and the process iterates over multiple generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The algorithm continues to evolve the population over several generations (100 in our case), with the aim of improving the quality of solutions over time. Through this process of selection, recombination, and mutation, the GA can explore the solution space and eventually converge towards an optimal or near-optimal solution."
